## Local Setup

For a hands-on walkthrough of running al-folio locally without using Docker, check out [this cool blog post](https://george-gca.github.io/blog/2022/running-local-al-folio/) by one of the community members!

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (_hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)_), and also [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (_hint: for ease of managing python packages, consider using a virtual environment, like [venv](https://docs.python.org/pt-br/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)_).

```bash
$ bundle install
# assuming pip is your Python package manager
$ pip install jupyter
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To see the template running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000`. You should see a copy of the theme's [demo website](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/). Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like. After you are done, remember to **commit** your final changes.
