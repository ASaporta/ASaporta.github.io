I’m a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the Courant Institute at NYU working on machine learning for health and advised by [Rajesh Ranganath](https://cims.nyu.edu/~rajeshr/). I’m a [DeepMind Scholar](https://www.deepmind.com/scholarships) and a [Shakti VC Fellow](https://shaktivc.com/). I also co-host [The AI Health Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ai-health-podcast/id1542731019) with [Pranav Rajpurkar](https://rajpurkar.github.io/).

Before joining NYU, I worked on research on Apple’s Health AI team and in Andrew Ng’s [Stanford Machine Learning Group](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/). In a previous life, I was Anna Wintour’s executive assistant at Vogue (remember The Devil Wears Prada?), and I’ve held engineering and product roles across both big tech (Apple, Amazon) and start-ups (SeatGeek, Common).

I have an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, and a BA in Comparative Literature from Yale University. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, and am half-Cuban and half-Greek.
